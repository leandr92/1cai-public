# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

*Format:* [Michael Nygard style](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)  
*Location:* `docs/architecture/adr/ADR-####-<slug>.md`

Each ADR captures a decision, the context that led to it, the options that were considered, and the consequences. Keep entries short (1-2 pages). When a decision is superseded, mark the old ADR as `Superseded by ADR-XXXX`.

## Workflow

1. Create a new ADR draft:  
   ```bash
   make adr-new SLUG=\"adopt-c4-structurizr\"
   ```
2. Discuss with the architectural working group, update `Status`.
3. Link the ADR from relevant pull requests, documentation and diagrams.
4. When the decision changes, add a new ADR and update `Superseded by`.
