## ❓ COMMON OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

**"It's too expensive"**

**"We don't trust AI"**
→ "Fair! That's why developer reviews everything AI suggests. AI is a tool, not a replacement. It's like spell-check for code!"

**"We're too small"**
→ "Actually, small teams benefit MORE! €99/month saves you €8,000/month. That's 80x ROI!"

**"We're happy with current process"**
→ "That's great! But are your developers happy doing boring repetitive tasks? AI frees them to do creative work they love!"

**"What if AI generates bad code?"**
